# Python - if/else, loops, funtions

In this project, I began by utilizing conditionals and loops inPython by using `if`, `if ... else`, `break`,'continue`, `pass` and `range` statements with `while` and `for` loops. I wrote my own python functions while leaning about scope of variables, indentation, tracebackes and arithmetic operators.
